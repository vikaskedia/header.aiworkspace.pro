# Domain Change Authentication Fix

## Problem
When navigating between different domains (e.g., from `app.aiworkspace.pro` to `dashboard.aiworkspace.pro`), the page needs to be reloaded 2-3 times before the authentication state is properly recognized.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a **race condition in cross-subdomain authentication synchronization** during domain changes:

1. **Initial Load Issue**: When opening a new domain, the authentication check happened before cross-subdomain cookies were properly synchronized
2. **Cookie Synchronization Delay**: The `ensureCrossSubdomainCookies()` function wasn't being called early enough in the initialization process
3. **Insufficient Retry Mechanism**: The retry mechanisms weren't aggressive enough for domain changes
4. **Session Validation Timing**: Session validation occurred before cross-subdomain cookies were fully synchronized

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Ultra-Early Cross-Subdomain Authentication Setup
- **New Function**: `setupImmediateCrossSubdomainAuth()` - Called immediately when the page loads
- **Purpose**: Ensures cross-subdomain cookies are synchronized before any authentication checks
- **Timing**: Executes synchronously during module initialization

### 2. Enhanced Domain Change Handler
- **New Function**: `handleDomainChangeAuth()` - Specifically designed for domain changes
- **Features**:
  - Immediate cookie synchronization
  - Aggressive retry mechanism (7 attempts with 25ms delays)
  - Asynchronous session restoration
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 3. Improved Retry Mechanism
- **Enhanced**: `restoreSessionWithRetry()` function
- **Changes**:
  - Increased max retries from 3 to 5
  - Reduced delay from 200ms to 100ms
  - More aggressive cookie re-synchronization between attempts

### 4. Multiple Cookie Synchronization
- **Enhanced**: `useEnhancedAuth` composable
- **Changes**:
  - Multiple cookie synchronization passes
  - Shorter delays between sync attempts (50ms)
  - Additional sync pass for domain changes

### 5. Immediate Initialization
- **Enhanced**: Supabase client initialization
- **Changes**:
  - Calls `handleDomainChangeAuth()` immediately
  - Multiple layers of cross-subdomain setup
  - Early execution during module load

## Technical Details

### Cookie Synchronization Flow
```
1. Page Load â†’ handleDomainChangeAuth() (immediate)
2. setupImmediateCrossSubdomainAuth() (immediate)
3. ensureCrossSubdomainCookies() (multiple times)
4. restoreSessionWithRetry() (aggressive retry)
5. Session validation and restoration
```

### Retry Strategy
- **Attempts**: 5-7 attempts (increased from 3)
- **Delays**: 25-100ms (reduced from 200ms)
- **Cookie Sync**: Between each attempt
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: All operations are asynchronous
- **Non-blocking**: UI remains responsive during authentication
- **Efficient**: Early detection prevents unnecessary retries

## Usage

### For Consuming Applications
The fix is automatically applied when importing the header package:

```javascript
import { AIWorkspaceHeader } from '@your-org/header-package'

// Cross-subdomain authentication is automatically set up
// No additional configuration required
```

### Manual Domain Change Handling (Optional)
If you need to manually trigger domain change authentication:

```javascript
import { handleDomainChangeAuth } from '@your-org/header-package'

// Call this immediately when navigating to a new domain
handleDomainChangeAuth()
```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Domain Navigation**: Navigate from `app.aiworkspace.pro` to `dashboard.aiworkspace.pro`
2. **Subdomain Switching**: Switch between different subdomains
3. **Session Persistence**: Verify session persists across domains
4. **Error Handling**: Test with network issues and invalid tokens

### Expected Behavior
- **Single Reload**: Authentication should work on the first page load
- **Immediate Recognition**: User should be recognized immediately
- **No Multiple Reloads**: Should not require 2-3 reloads anymore

## Monitoring

### Console Logs
The fix includes comprehensive logging for debugging:

```
[auth][domain-change] Handling domain change authentication...
[auth][immediate] Setting up immediate cross-subdomain authentication...
[auth][restore] Attempt 1/7
[auth][restore] Session restored successfully
```

### Error Tracking
All errors are logged with context:
- Domain change authentication errors
- Cookie synchronization failures
- Session restoration issues

## Backward Compatibility

- **Fully Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing APIs
- **Automatic**: Fix is applied automatically without configuration
- **Fallback**: Original behavior is preserved if new functions fail

## Future Improvements

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time session synchronization
2. **Service Worker**: Background session management
3. **Predictive Loading**: Pre-authenticate likely destinations
4. **Analytics**: Track domain change success rates

## Troubleshooting

### If Issues Persist
1. Check browser console for authentication logs
2. Verify cross-subdomain cookies are being set
3. Ensure proper domain configuration
4. Check network connectivity

### Common Issues
- **Cookie Domain Mismatch**: Verify apex domain configuration
- **Network Delays**: Increase retry delays if needed
- **Browser Security**: Check SameSite cookie policies

## Conclusion

This fix eliminates the need for multiple page reloads when navigating between domains by implementing aggressive, early cross-subdomain authentication synchronization. The solution is automatic, backward-compatible, and provides comprehensive error handling and monitoring.
