# OAuth Redirect Fix - Debug Guide

## ‚úÖ **Issue Fixed**

The OAuth redirect was not preserving the full URL path after login. Users were being redirected to `/` instead of their original page like `/all-workspace/dashboard`.

## üîß **What Was Fixed**

1. **Enhanced parameter detection** - Now checks both search params and hash params
2. **Added `redirect_origin` support** - Handles the OAuth query parameter properly
3. **Improved URL parsing** - Extracts path from full stored URLs
4. **Added comprehensive logging** - Better debugging for redirect flow

## üöÄ **Update Instructions**

In the production app, run:

```bash
npm uninstall @aiworkspace/shared-header
npm install git+https://github.com/vikaskedia/header.aiworkspace.pro.git
```

## üîç **Testing Steps**

1. **Go to the specific page**: `https://all-ws-dashboard.aiworkspace.pro/all-workspace/dashboard`
2. **Click the login button**
3. **Complete OAuth login**
4. **Check console logs** for these messages:
   ```
   [getPostLoginBase] Stored URL from storage: https://all-ws-dashboard.aiworkspace.pro/all-workspace/dashboard
   [getPostLoginBase] Extracted path from stored URL: /all-workspace/dashboard
   [getPostLoginBase] Final candidate from storage: /all-workspace/dashboard
   [UniversalCallback] Final redirect URL: /all-workspace/dashboard
   [UniversalCallback] redirecting to: https://all-ws-dashboard.aiworkspace.pro/all-workspace/dashboard
   ```

## üéØ **Expected Result**

After login, you should be redirected back to:
`https://all-ws-dashboard.aiworkspace.pro/all-workspace/dashboard`

**Not to:**
`https://all-ws-dashboard.aiworkspace.pro/`

## üêõ **If Still Not Working**

Check the browser console for these debug messages:

1. **What URL was stored?**
   ```
   [OAuth] Stored redirect URL: [URL]
   ```

2. **What was retrieved?**
   ```
   [getPostLoginBase] Stored URL from storage: [URL]
   [getPostLoginBase] Final candidate from storage: [PATH]
   ```

3. **Where was it redirecting?**
   ```
   [UniversalCallback] Final redirect URL: [PATH]
   [UniversalCallback] redirecting to: [FULL_URL]
   ```

The fix should now properly preserve the full URL path after OAuth login! üöÄ
