# Cross-Subdomain Authentication Fix

## Problem
When logged into one app and opening another app, the login/signup button shows initially instead of recognizing the logged-in user. After reloading 1-2 times, it then shows the logged-in user.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a race condition in cross-subdomain authentication synchronization:

1. **Initial Load Issue**: When opening a new app, the authentication check happened before cross-subdomain cookies were properly synchronized
2. **Cookie Synchronization Delay**: The `ensureCrossSubdomainCookies()` function wasn't being called early enough
3. **No Retry Mechanism**: Failed authentication attempts weren't retried with proper delays

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Restoration (`useEnhancedAuth.ts`)
- Added immediate cross-subdomain cookie synchronization before authentication check
- Implemented retry mechanism with progressive delays (100ms, 500ms)
- Added localStorage backup for cookie restoration
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

### 2. Improved Cookie Synchronization (`authRedirect.ts`)
- Enhanced `ensureCrossSubdomainCookies()` to use localStorage as backup
- Added fallback mechanism when cookies aren't immediately available
- Improved cross-subdomain cookie promotion logic

### 3. Retry Mechanism (`crossSubdomainAuth.ts`)
- Added `restoreSessionWithRetry()` with configurable retry attempts and delays
- Implemented progressive delay strategy (200ms, 400ms, 600ms)
- Added cross-subdomain cookie re-sync between retry attempts
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. Immediate Initialization (`crossSubdomainAuth.ts`)
- Added `initializeCrossSubdomainAuth()` function for immediate setup
- Ensures cross-subdomain cookies are synchronized on app load
- Sets up auth state listener immediately
- Provides quick session restoration with shorter delays

### 5. Visual Feedback (`AIWorkspaceHeader.vue`)
- Added loading state during authentication synchronization
- Shows "Syncing authentication..." message during auth check
- Prevents showing login button prematurely

## Key Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `src/composables/useEnhancedAuth.ts` - Enhanced session restoration
2. `src/plugins/crossSubdomainAuth.ts` - Added retry mechanism and initialization
3. `src/utils/authRedirect.ts` - Improved cookie synchronization
4. `src/components/AIWorkspaceHeader.vue` - Added visual feedback

### New Functions:
- `initializeCrossSubdomainAuth()` - Immediate cross-subdomain auth setup
- `restoreSessionWithRetry()` - Enhanced retry mechanism
- Enhanced `ensureCrossSubdomainCookies()` - localStorage backup support

## Testing Instructions

1. **Login to one app** (e.g., app.aiworkspace.pro)
2. **Open another app** (e.g., tasks.aiworkspace.pro) in a new tab
3. **Verify**: The app should immediately show the logged-in user without requiring reloads
4. **Check console logs**: Look for `[auth][init]` and `[auth][restore]` messages
5. **Test across all 7 apps** to ensure consistent behavior

## Expected Behavior

- **Before**: Login button shows → reload 1-2 times → shows logged-in user
- **After**: Immediately shows logged-in user on first load

## Debugging

If issues persist, check browser console for:
- `[auth][init]` messages for initialization status
- `[auth][restore]` messages for session restoration attempts
- `[auth][cookie][promote]` messages for cookie synchronization
- Any error messages during the authentication process

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact (100-500ms delays only during authentication)
- Improved user experience by eliminating need for manual reloads
- Better error handling and recovery mechanisms
